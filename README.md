**Here you find a readme!**
In this folder you find:

- [x] Exampels are processed from the exercises found in *Introduction to Java Programming Comprehensive Version* *Tenth Edition*
- [ ] Boring stuff
- [x] Exercises from the book mentioned above (chapter 1 - 8)

Almost everything I coded can be runned from the Exercises Class in each chapter package. With a few exeptions though.. 
Just follow the inline comments in the code.

To be totally honest, I'm not really sure what to put in a readme.  :sparkles: :camel: :boom:

**I can however show off some cool Markdown stuff**
